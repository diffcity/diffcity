This first release is releasing a few helper-components of diffcity.
Diffcity (dct) is a commandline tool for system administrators.
Its main uses will be:
 - Reporting low-level checks for config changes in your servers.
   It will report changes over time of password files, firewall rules, security settings, etc.
   It can take into account individual server configs.
   You can easily make your own plugins, to have checks for stuff you wish to keep an eye on
 - Interactive: filtering out info you find unimportant
   Some log files, and even some everyday command line outputs, just return too much info.
   For log files, diffcity has a heuristic filter, as well as a deduplicator.
   For command lines that are too chatty, diffcity can pre-read it, and filter out all stuff you wish to ignore :)

Diffcity has been in development for pretty many years now.
Formerly, we wished to release a complete package, with everything ready.
But now, we think we'd better release components which are already usable, building dct along the way.

Today, two helper components are released:
- problemeye
- clobber

Problemeye is meant for scanning logfiles.
Many logfiles are of an overwhelming size.
Problemeye searches heuristically for problems like errors.
It can help sysadmins who want to have a quick look if a servers (huge) log file(s) contain(s) any kind of problems.

Clobber is a deduplication tool.
It, too, can give a quick insight into a (huge) log file.
Deduplicaton may reveal that 1000s of loglines are really from a handful of different messages, repeated over and over again.

Feedback is very welcome.
The project is pretty big, I will work on it in some of my free time.
Working and hoping to get new components added soon.

Best regards,
